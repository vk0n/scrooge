# Scrooge — Binance Futures Runtime, Control Plane, and Replayable Backtests

Scrooge is an event-driven trading system for Binance Futures with three cooperating layers:
- `bot/` for live runtime, exchange integration, and stateful execution
- `core/` for shared strategy and event logic
- `backtest/` for dataset building, discrete backtest running, replay, reporting, and optimization

It currently supports:
- live trading with websocket-driven market and account updates
- a local control plane (`api/` + `frontend/`)
- discrete backtests
- canonical event logging and replay artifacts
- a canonical discrete market tape for backtest runs
- a realtime-grade market event stream path for both historical and live replay

## Installation

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vk0n/scrooge.git
cd scrooge
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv scrooge-env
source scrooge-env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements/full.txt
```

Notes:
- `requirements/full.txt` is the full local toolchain
- `docker/bot.Dockerfile` installs `requirements/bot.txt`
- `docker/backtest.Dockerfile` installs `requirements/backtest.txt`

### 4. Create `.env`

At minimum:

```env
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

If you run the control plane locally, also set:

```env
SCROOGE_GUI_USERNAME=admin
SCROOGE_GUI_PASSWORD=strong_password_here
```

## Configuration

Live trading config:
- [live.yaml](config/live.yaml)

Backtest config:
- [backtest.yaml](config/backtest.yaml)

Optimization grid:
- [param_grid.yaml](config/param_grid.yaml)

Current canonical timeframe setup is:
- `small`: price/decision frame
- `medium`: Bollinger Bands + ATR frame
- `big`: RSI + EMA frame

## Usage

### Local live runtime

Uses `config/live.yaml` by default:

```bash
python main.py
```

Local runtime artifacts will appear under:
- `runtime/state.json`
- `runtime/trading_log.txt`
- `runtime/trade_history.jsonl`
- `runtime/balance_history.jsonl`
- `runtime/event_history.jsonl`
- `runtime/market_events.jsonl`
- `runtime/chart_dataset.csv`

`runtime/market_events.jsonl` now carries:
- market data events (`price_tick`, `mark_price`, `candle_closed`, `indicator_snapshot`)
- account/execution events (`account_balance`, `position_snapshot`, `order_trade_update`)

### Local backtest

Run against `config/backtest.yaml`:

```bash
SCROOGE_CONFIG_PATH=config/backtest.yaml python main.py
```

Backtest outputs include:
- runtime artifacts for the run
- `market_tape.jsonl`
- `market_events.jsonl`
- `market_event_execution_summary.json`
- `market_event_execution_events.jsonl`
- `market_event_execution_fills.jsonl`
- `market_event_execution_trades.jsonl`
- `market_event_trade_alignment_summary.json`
- `market_event_trade_alignment_pairs.jsonl`
- canonical `event_history.jsonl`
- `replay_summary.json`
- `replay_trades.jsonl`

The execution artifacts are derived from the active execution path:
- from replayed `market_events.jsonl` when `execution_mode: observed`
- from synthetic execution events emitted by the engine when `execution_mode: simulated`

They summarize/filter:
- account balance snapshots
- position snapshots
- order trade updates
- observed fills reconstructed from `order_trade_update`
- observed execution trades reconstructed from those fills
- alignment between strategy trades and observed execution trades

The backtest execution path is now owned by:
- `backtest/runner.py`
- `backtest/discrete_tape.py`
- `backtest/market_event_projection.py`

The realtime-grade stream path is owned by:
- `backtest/agg_trade_market_event_stream.py`
- `backtest/historical_market_event_stream.py`
- `core/market_events.py`

Backtest input modes:
- `backtest_input_mode: build` — fetch/build dataset, derive `market_tape.jsonl`, and synthesize a historical `market_events.jsonl`
- `backtest_input_mode: discrete_tape` — start from an existing `market_tape.jsonl` and synthesize a historical `market_events.jsonl`
- `backtest_input_mode: market_event_stream` — start directly from an existing `market_events.jsonl`, while also projecting `market_tape.jsonl` as an artifact
- `backtest_input_mode: agg_trade_stream` — fetch historical Binance Futures `aggTrades`, compress them into `price_tick` events, synthesize `1m/1h/4h candle_closed` plus `indicator_snapshot`, and write a native historical `market_events.jsonl`

Historical `market_events.jsonl` synthesized from candles includes:
- intrabar `price_tick` events derived from the `1m` OHLC path
- `candle_closed` events for `1m`, `1h`, and `4h`
- `indicator_snapshot` events for discrete replay compatibility

Historical `market_events.jsonl` synthesized from `aggTrades` includes:
- `price_tick` events derived from public Binance Futures aggregate trades
- by default, tick compression to `1s` so the stream stays practical for local replay
- `candle_closed` events for `1m`, `1h`, and `4h` rebuilt from those trades
- `indicator_snapshot` events rebuilt from the resulting candle history

When replaying from `market_event_stream`, the resulting `state.json` also carries execution-sync context when available:
- `execution_sync`
- `exchange_balance`
- `exchange_position`
- `last_order_trade_update`

Strategy modes:
- `strategy_mode: discrete` — canonical baseline
- `strategy_mode: realtime` — event-driven evaluation on a realtime-grade `market_events.jsonl` built from history or captured live

Execution modes:
- `execution_mode: simulated` — strategy fills/balance are simulated by the engine
- `execution_mode: observed` — balance and position are taken from `account_balance` / `position_snapshot` events; requires `backtest_input_mode: market_event_stream`

To replay from an existing tape, set in `config/backtest.yaml`:

```yaml
backtest_input_mode: discrete_tape
market_tape_input_path: /path/to/market_tape.jsonl
```

To replay from an existing market event stream:

```yaml
backtest_input_mode: market_event_stream
execution_mode: observed
market_event_input_path: /path/to/market_events.jsonl
```

That `market_events.jsonl` can come either from:
- a backtest-generated historical realtime stream
- or a live bot runtime captured at `runtime/market_events.jsonl`

To build a historical event stream from Binance `aggTrades`:

```yaml
backtest_input_mode: agg_trade_stream
strategy_mode: realtime
execution_mode: simulated
agg_trade_source: archive
agg_trade_tick_interval: 1s
```

Notes:
- `agg_trade_source: archive` uses Binance public data and automatically fills the latest missing tail through REST when needed
- `agg_trade_source: rest` is available, but it is practical only for shorter windows
- `agg_trade_tick_interval: 1s` is the recommended default for realtime backtests; `raw` is available but can get very heavy very quickly on BTCUSDT
- raw agg-trade downloads are cached by default under `data/agg_trades/`; control this with `agg_trade_cache_enabled` and `agg_trade_cache_dir`

### Replay a canonical event log

```bash
python -m backtest.replay /path/to/event_history.jsonl --runtime-mode backtest --strategy-mode discrete
```

### Parameter optimization

```bash
python -m backtest.optimize
```

The optimizer reads:
- `config/param_grid.yaml`

### Docker / Compose

For current compose-based deploy flow, profiles, and runtime model, see:
- [DEPLOY_DOCKER.md](DEPLOY_DOCKER.md)

## Strategy Outline

Scrooge currently runs a multi-timeframe discrete strategy:
- entries are evaluated from the `small` frame with `medium` and `big` filters
- stop loss and take profit are ATR-based
- trailing protection can activate after price moves beyond the base target
- state, trade history, balance history, UI log, and canonical event history are persisted

The longer-term direction of the project is:
- keep `discrete` mode as the stable baseline
- build toward shared-core replay/backtest infrastructure
- later add a separate `realtime` strategy mode without losing the ability to compare it against the discrete baseline

## Philosophy of Scrooge

Scrooge is not human — and that’s his greatest strength.
He does not hope, fear, hesitate, or overthink.
Where humans trade with emotion, Scrooge trades with mathematics.

He sees the market as a field of probabilities, not possibilities.
He doesn’t chase euphoria or revenge after loss.
Every position is just data, every outcome a statistical event.

While traders battle psychology, Scrooge operates in logic.
He never over-leverages from greed, never panics on a red candle.
He acts only when signals align, exits only when math demands it.

Scrooge represents the elimination of emotion and the automation of discipline.
His only loyalty is to the algorithm — consistent, adaptive, and entirely emotionless.
